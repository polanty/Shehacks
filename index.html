             Due to inherent weak geology, rock instability, population explosions and deforestation, all rivers emanating from Himalayas carry enormous quantity of silt during heavy runoff of monsoon from June to September.
         </p>
         <p>
             Hydro Power stations located in Himalayan region face heavy silt problems during high inflow periods. Siul River carries heavy silt concentration of the order of 30,000 PPM (Part Per Million) (4) affecting generation, eroding turbines and cooling water system, requiring heavy cost towards maintenance of Baira Siul project.

               Field mapping was carried out in the study area after a cautious scrutiny and detail study of the area. The map is then gridded into smaller squares to serve as guide in moving through the area. Then a point was taken on the map to serve as bench mark i.e starting point for studying the area.

         <p>      An elaborate geological field mapping was done. The sedimentary structures were studied and a hole was dug into the sedimentary rock using hand dug and shovel later a tape rule was use to measure the depth of the hole. Coordinate and elevation of the area was taking using a standard GPS. Other general study such as the color, bedding planes and associate features were studied and taking in consideration. </p>
