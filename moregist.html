            	For each of the sample, 50g was taking in each for the analysis with the following sieve opening was used(2.0,1.4,1.0,0.710,0.500,0.355,0.250,0.180,0.125,0.088 and  phi size corresponding to the sieve diameter were also taking into writing and they are:(-1.0,-0.5,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.5,2.0,2.5,3.5 and 4.0). A retaining pan was included at the based of the sieve to collect the clay size particles, the sieve were arranged in an increasing other from the bottom top, 50g of the each 6 labeled samples were pour into the topmost sieve mesh and it was shaking for at least  10 minutes.
                </p>
         <p>
           	After shaking for 10 minutes, the sieve stack was taking off likewise the sieve cover at the topmost part and the weight retained sand for each sieve diameter opening was measured and recorded as : weight retained in g. Then after this the total sample weight retained was then calculated by adding all the value of each sieve diameter opening together.

                   Samples taking from field were sent to University of Ibadan to be petrologicaly analysed in there Geology lab where they are cut into slides and they studied under petrologic microscope, the slides were also examined under petrologic microscope in Ladoke Akintola University of Technology to identify the mineral present.

      The slides were examined under petrographic microscope in both cross polarized and plane polarized light. Minerals present in each samples were identified and named
